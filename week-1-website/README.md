This site is a recreation of https://spacey-kappa.vercel.app/. The purpose of this assignment was to use html and CSS to achieve a similar aesthetic.

Requirements:

- Ensured each section of the webpage is wrapped in the correct semantic tags, ensuring that it includes a <header>, <nav>, and <footer>.
- Implemented CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image or another element.
- Utilised CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout, particularly in the <nav> element.
- Ensured all image elements (<img>) are correctly implemented with accurate src file paths.

Stretch tasks:

- Implemented smooth scrolling for internal links to improve user experience.
- Implemented a hover effect on elements to make them more interactive.

Not completed:

- Back to top button.
- Footer with social media icons that link to social media pages.
- Background music track that plays automatically when the website loads.

Extra things I would like to add:

- Gradient at the bottom of each section.
- Header that changes opacity while scrolling for clearer viewing.
- Dynamic hover effects.

Resources I found helpful:

- Moodle pages on the box-model.
- CSS diner selector, flexbox froggy, flexbox tower defense, CSS Flexbox layout guide.
- https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_smooth_scroll.asp.

Challenges I faced:

- Styling the header using flexbox was the most challenging.
- I had issues with the backdrop image covering the header. This was fixed by utilising the z-index property.
